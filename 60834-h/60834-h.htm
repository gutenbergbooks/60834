  <h2 class='c005'>THE BENEFIT OF THOUGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The worst as well as the best of us in this world, sometimes
love to stop and think. The bad man, wanting every fine feeling,
and mostly giving his passions the rein, and suffering them to lead
him, to the exclusion of what is beautiful in morals and religion, will
sometimes be struck with the contrast between himself and others,
and give a few moments to thought. Besides, there are, from the
mutual relation of mind and body, certain states of physical feeling,
which seem to make men pause, and set them thinking, whether
they will or not. In fact, this seems a provision of nature, and it is a
benevolent one; for men who think a great deal, are improved by
it; and if so, it is obviously a kind plan of our Maker, who, by giving
us constitutions susceptible of the changes in the natural world,
leads us, thereby, to pause awhile, and familiarize ourselves with
that which is wisest and best in the constitutions of our souls.</p>

<p class='c011'>That a man is improved by thinking much, few will deny. If
he sits and thinks upon his secular concerns, or employs himself in
ambitious speculations, or upon any other of the subjects which beguile
the greater part of the human family, we would not say he
was improved, at least, but little, by it. But we think a man who now
and then gives himself to solitude, will not employ his mind thus.
It is a law of our natures, that earthly objects, even the best, and
purest, if pursued long, and obtained in profusion, have a tendency
to induce satiety and disgust. Most men have had experience of
this; for few are there, we think, who have not, after calculating
long on the delights of a prospective good, found on its attainment,
its comparative worthlessness and insufficiency. Now the man who
devotes a few moments to reflection, will have this great inducement
to lead his mind off from such subjects as tend only to make
him the more of a worldling, viz. that they cannot satisfy. Moreover,
if he does not know, or does not remember this, as the result
of former experience, he will (unless he be yoked with fetters of iron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>to the world, and his whole character be different from that of other
men) if at first, in his retirement, he gives his mind up to outward
objects, or to such as serve his worst passions—after a while, even
then, experience the same, or something of the same satiety. The
mind then turns somewhere else, for it must have nourishment; and
whither, but into itself. It is thus, retirement puts a man in the way
of being better.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the mind abstracted from outward, every-day objects, or such
as have dominion over it through the medium of the senses, will
soon become acquainted with its own noble faculties. It certainly
is a truth, and every thinking man will remark it as he mingles with
men, that they all seem unconscious of their natures. A wiser
than man has revealed to us, and Philosophy tells us, that there are
fountains of bliss in ourselves; and that if we taste of these, we shall
look upon those things which constitute most of the enjoyment of
our race, as worth little or nothing. Of this truth, we say, men seem
ignorant. A being with half our natural faculties, would be capacitated
for about as much bliss as most men take. The extent of
many, we may say of most of the human family’s ideas of happiness,
might almost be comprehended by a sagacious animal. Does
it not consist mainly, in securing such a portion of worldly substance,
as shall make them comfortable? It is so, manifestly. Now let me
ask, if this, in the scale of being, elevates us much above brutes.
Brutes do all this; and it might be remarked without much hazard,
that, instinct taken into account, they take a higher stand than we
do. Retirement, however, turning the mind into itself, as remarked
above, tends to correct this evil; and did society think more, its
condition would instantly be improved. Thought opens new sources
of thought; these sources other sources, increasing in tenfold
ratio: and this unravels that which is so often esteemed a mystery
by many, viz. that men, once devoted to books, can never be
brought back to business men; and, furthermore, it shows an egregious
error in those who account for this devotion, on the grounds of
habit. That we are creatures of habit in a great degree, none will
deny; but that habit can be broken, is as readily admitted—whereas,
this devotion was never known to be lessened.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man who thinks much, in addition to the discovery of his
great mental powers, discovers, also, his great moral capacities.
Things that once struck him as strange in his moral constitution,
and which, as they seemed inexplicable, he had so often dismissed
with a glance, he now discovers, are so many evidences of a relationship
to the Divine being: all is illuminated which, before, was
so dark: the film passes from his eye: what he thought but a stagnant
pool, he finds, now, is an ocean whose waters are limpid and
sweet, the bottom of which is strewn with the richest and rarest
shells: every exertion reveals to him a new treasure, until he wonders
within himself at that perversity and blindness, which could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>pass over, undiscovered, such deep sources of improvement. Now
one result of all this is, that he gains a just sense of the dignity of his
being. We know how fashionable it is, to decry human nature;
and we doubt not we shall receive censure, for turning off from such
a beaten path. The great and good, of almost all time, have rather
preferred to find fault, than bestow on it eulogium. But it seems to
us, an abuse, and a perversion, for looking over society as we do,
and catching here and there so many evidences of bright and heroic
virtues as are presented—we cannot follow the fashion, and say, every
man is altogether bad. There is every thing in the soul which
is noble: it bears the imprint of a divine hand: and though its fair
phasis be soiled, and blackened, as doubtless it is, by transgression,
there are, nevertheless, some intelligent spots left, to show its divine
origin.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another result of patient thought is, a man discovers his proper
relationship to society. Self-knowledge tends greatly to remove
selfishness. By it, he learns his obligation, not only to God, but
man; he begins to see how impossible it is, to live an isolated being;
and he begins to feel, in its full force, that beautiful truth, that
he is a part of the great chain which links society together. In proportion
as he feels this, must his selfishness give place to nobler feelings.
No man exhibits a more unprepossessing ignorance, than he
who sets at nought the opinions, and feelings of others. He becomes
an object of pity, and even contempt, to every thinking man;
for so little is required to see his error, that we despise his oversight.
If men did but know it, it is the cause of a large portion of the unhappiness
of life. Society never finds a person in its midst, entirely
wrapped in self, and scorning its good will, but it leaves such to the
fate they merit, viz. to test their ill grounded belief, and see if they
<em>can</em> live, setting at nought the doctrine of mutual dependence. No!
men were made dependent—mutually dependent—and it is the
loveliest thing in morals that it is so; for just so far as it is recognized,
is selfishness destroyed, and harmony established among men.
This doctrine ought to be held up more than it is, especially in this
nation: it would serve to correct and counteract, if any thing can do
it, that spirit of self-interest, always the result of popular and free
institutions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The moral powers are greatly improved, also, by thought, and as
a consequence, the moral taste. It is unfortunate, we think, that so
much should have been said, and written, as there has been, on beauty
and taste, and moral beauty, and moral taste, so often left out of
the account. The order and harmony in Nature, has never wanted
admirers; and eulogists, by scores, are found, to speak of high deeds,
and heroic attachments. In the Arts, too, the ideal symmetry of
Phidias; the burning canvass of Michael Angelo; and the fabulous
shell of Orpheus—these have never lacked encomium. On the contrary,
there has been something like a mad emulation among men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>from the bright era of Grecian Pericles until now, to invent epithets
of admiration. But how are high deeds and heroic virtues ennobled—what
added grace and dignity is afforded the Fine Arts, when
the principles of moral beauty are associated! Our object here,
however, shall not be to discover, why moral taste is neglected, but
rather to find out some principles by which it may be seen, and improved,
wherever there is a wish for its culture. Taste is doubtless
an inherent faculty; and, if the doctrine of innate ideas is admitted,
then moral taste is an inherent faculty. Now every thing which
relates to morals, affects moral taste; they cannot be dissociated:
hence, would you look for its liveliest exercise, you will take the
most elevated character. In such you will observe it, not in great
display, but in the thousand little offices of life,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Those little, nameless, unremember’d acts</div>
      <div class='line'>Of kindness and of love.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It checks them, at every little departure from rectitude, and is a
good and efficient guide, in all their intercourse with men. If a man
would <em>improve</em> his moral taste, let him, instead of that pernicious
habit of revery to which there are so many inducements, especially
in retirement, give his thoughts to the excellence of moral virtues:
let him look at those sparks of beauty, so to speak, sometimes struck
off from heroic characters, in trying circumstances: let him trace
them in their two-fold results, as affecting others, and then refracting
on himself; and much have we mistaken the human mind, if the
practice do not benefit him. We are not aware of the extent of
the benefit of a taste rightly understood, and rightly directed, because
it is so very subtle and delicate; nevertheless, those many
imperceptible advances which it makes against an ill regulated mind,
operate powerfully as a whole, and do modify the disposition to a
degree little dreamed of. It improves a man’s <em>whole</em> character, and
throws a charm around it, not otherwise, than as the flush sometimes
seen lying along the sky of evening, which, thrown down to the
earth by the atmosphere, gives it all a mellow glow of beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the above, we detect another truth. There are in society,
certain little observances, which tend to regulate it—such as the
forms of etiquette; which observances, it is deemed can best be
learned <em>in</em> society. This we deem a very pernicious doctrine. It
is reasoning from wrong premises; and false <em>data</em> in moral, assuredly
bring about as wrong deductions, as in physical science. The
very object to be attained, viz. the regulation of society, not only
goes to show, that it is something which is extraneous, but presupposes
that it can never be found there: and yet we are told, that
politeness is the result of social intercourse. But this we believe
not. So far from it, we believe that true politeness is <em>never</em> learned
there. Society is nothing but a hot bed—what grows in it, is rank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and unwholesome. True, there is a something passing for politeness,
very meaningless, and very stiff; but it is, at the same time,
so very shallow, that men of sense make no pretensions to it: and
<em>this</em> is learned <em>in</em> society. True politeness is of another growth. It
is the offspring of correct principle; and any thing springing from
such a source, we may not be much afraid of. True politeness is
nothing but a refined kind of humanity; and give a man a kind
heart, and one regulated by correct taste; and never fear, but he has
that which will make his way any where, to the utter exclusion of
these danglers on the skirts of good breeding. It is a sad thing,
that we have such an abundance of <em>manners</em> in the world, and so
little <em>character</em>: that men think so little, they have mostly become
frivolous and superficial: that frivolous and superficial manners, best
become them. This is true however. We <em>have</em> lost the substance,
and taken the shadow; and now, in groping for it, we have got a
substitute, without one of the virtues of its expatriated pre-occupant.</p>

<p class='c011'>But though the age is not one marked by any very severe exercise
of thought, and though utilitarian principles are threatening to
sweep away almost every kind of speculative knowledge, yet we are
not greatly fearful as to the result. The system is revolving, and a
better succession will soon be among us. And why? Our hope is,
in the fast increasing intelligence of the world. Though we might,
and, did we give our mind, we should, find complaint, in respect to
many of the features of the spirit of the day, deeming it too clamorous,
and active, as having a tendency to injure what is pure and
beautiful, in the ideal world—still, intelligence is fast and widely diffused;
and on the whole, doubtless, the good will predominate.
Those rank plants among us, such as false taste, sickly sensibility,
affectation, and the like, will be crowded out by those of healthier
growth, and society put on a new aspect; while, as evils, we shall
have too much of a captious, matter-of-fact atmosphere, which rejects
every thing not immediately communicated, through the medium of
the senses. This, however, will be counteracted in some degree, by
the few that <em>do</em> think: and, further, by that <em>other</em> few, who in all
states of society hold their own, uncontaminated by that which is
about them. These are they who bring into existence with them,
those susceptibilities of harmony in the natural and moral world—minds,
which separate them from their fellows—feelings, which earth
never appreciates—and aspirations, which carry them up to breathe
in a purer atmosphere, where the bustle, ‘and hoarse enginery of
Life’ cannot come. These, we say, have an influence in society,
though they are above it—‘birds of heavenly plumage fair,’ that,
stooping occasionally from higher regions, appear for a moment, and
then are gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>In conclusion: the benefit of thought is most manifest, in that
proper self-confidence, without which, there is no real dignity of
character. To be a growing man, is to be a confident one; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the secret of greatness, lies in the consciousness of the ability to be
great. We should be sorry to advocate folly,—modesty, we are
taught from our cradles, is a virtue,—but by some unaccountable
process, the thing has got to signifying something, better designated
sheepishness; and hence, we have an <em>animal</em> virtue. Different
from these, however, are our ideas of modesty. True modesty is
that proper appreciation of one’s own powers, which leads him never
to offend, either by bashfulness or presumption: now, who so likely
to hit the mark, as he who knows the strength of the bow. The
workings of a great mind, conscious of its capacities—and its aspirations
for eminence, are, in distinction to the greatness of little men,
as opposite as possible—the one a mighty river, always overflowing,
and enriching the soil through which it moves, with its abundant and
generous fullness—the other an insignificant stream, always within its
banks, as grudging the smallest pittance to the scene around. To
be a modest man in a certain usage, is to be an ignorant one—for to
underrate one’s self, and be honest in it, is to show ignorance of self;
and he who knows not himself, has skipped the first page in the
book of wisdom: but to be a modest man in a right sense, is to be a
wise one—for it is a knowledge of self (which we suppose constitutes
a wise man) that enables one to seize upon and retain, his proper
station in society. It is this latter kind of modesty which is commendable.
It is that of great men. It is that which, meet it where
we will, we love to praise. Milton could stop, mid-word in one
of his loudest invectives against the rotten fabric of Episcopacy, and
speak of himself as ‘a poet sitting in the high regions of his fancy, with
his garlands and singing robes about him’—and, with voice like the
wild note of prophecy, proclaim ‘the great argument,’ as yet sleeping
in the darkness of his vision; and of his confidence to produce a
work ‘that posterity should not willingly let die.’ Was this folly?
and yet, it was a full appreciation of what the great God had given
him. No! It was knowledge—knowledge at home—knowledge
gained by thought—the knowledge of energies proud enough, to
build up a colossal monument to posterity—<em>and he did it</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>These are some of the advantages, we think, of a substantial
knowledge of ourselves; and when we look at the age, and see how
headlong it is, and how dangerously practical it is becoming; too much
cannot be said, and too loudly it cannot be spoken, that there is need
of more reflection, and more forethought.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MACBETH.</h2>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There is some soul of goodness in things evil.”—<em>King Henry V.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Macbeth is a historical character. He is one of those who
stand on the page of history as personifications of vice, rather than
as men who possess any thing in common with ourselves. They
distinguished themselves by a career of crime—in general that crime
arose from ambition,—their names have become a proverb, and are
associated in our minds with a particular form of vice as the entire
and bare sum of their character. Yet when thus viewed, what are
called examples affect us little more than a lifeless homily. They
raise in us no sympathy, and of course no interest. They may indeed
excite a hatred of that abstract form of vice, but against that
we feel secure, and we make no attempt to derive from them any
further benefit. Our abhorrence forbids; for we look upon them
not as human beings with their varying hues, but as monsters, almost
as monsters born. This horror, thus excited at personified vice,
seems to speak well for our hearts, yet it will be found to prevent us
from taking discriminating views of such characters, and from deriving
any practical wisdom from them. We do not reflect that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>were men like ourselves, that though deeply sunk in vice, they
were once as innocent as we may suppose ourselves to be; that it
was by objects working upon what is within every one of us, that
they became what they were; that the deeper they were involved
in the coil of wickedness, the more narrowly does it become us,
would we derive true wisdom or true knowledge from them, to
search out those places in the heart where its cords were first fastened
on them; to find what was first effectually touched to make them
what they were. Nor do we reflect that to obtain any practical
knowledge of men, it is no way to separate whatever of good there
may be in such characters, from the bad, however great it may be;
since it is only to be obtained by observing the struggle between the
two as they actually stand connected. Nor need we fear to admire
too much, that, in the most vicious mind, which is worthy of our admiration;
as if we should detest vice the less, for seeing the ruin it
makes, or for detecting its insidiousness in undermining the fair qualities
which may call forth our praise.</p>

<p class='c011'>An excellent means of thus presenting to us the characters of
history, as they are in their original cast, and as they progress or
change in the course of events, may be found in the drama. The
living beings in all their “intensity of life,” are before us; with the
circumstances of life about them—whether actual circumstances or
not is of little importance, if they are such as might have been expected.
The scenes of a whole life pass rapidly, yet distinctly and
freshly before us, as imagination loves, and as we should review the
eventful life of one whom we had well known.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tragedy before us moves towards its conclusion with a fearful
rapidity, which we vainly wish to detain; and is invested with
a stern and awful solemnity, disturbed only by thrilling scenes of
horror.</p>

<p class='c011'>Macbeth, the kinsman of king Duncan, and general of his army,
returning from a victorious battle, is met by three witches, two of
whom hail him with titles of nobility, which are almost instantly confirmed,
and the third with that of future king. Led by this and his
own ambition, he, at the suggestion of his wife, murders at midnight
the king whom he had entertained, and charges the deed upon his
guards. He is crowned, and to maintain his crown, is led into a series
of butcheries, which ends in his own death by the hand of Macduff,
aided by the English, who had been invited over by the sons
of the murdered Duncan.</p>

<p class='c011'>It might seem, at first view, that Macbeth is only one among the
slaves of a vulgar ambition, which implies a mind already hardened,
and which, attracted by some splendid object, sets itself,
from purely selfish ends, to the attainment of it, and after some visitings
of remorse, becomes thoroughly obdurate. The elements of
such a character are gross and palpable; the representations obvious;
and it is, we think, under this impression that this play has been pronounced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to contain “no nice discriminations of character.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> But if we
consider that Macbeth is in a great degree the subject of influence,
acted upon rather than acting, and in some respects more sinned
against than sinning; and how, at last, it is the sarcasm of his wife, and
the fear of disappointing her whom he loves, full as much as his own
ambition, which prevails on him to do the murder, the character
becomes more complicated, and we are constrained to find the good
and bad in it more evenly balanced, than we at first thought they
could be. The truth about Macbeth seems to be, that with the peculiar
openness of a hero, and with all his grandeur of intellect, together
with nice discrimination of all that may become a man, he is
wanting in that <em>energy of reflection</em>, which imparts integrity or moral
entireness to the mind. In this respect, his conduct is well contrasted
with that of Banquo, upon the reception of the infernal prediction.
The want of this trait accounts also for the fact, that he is
never self-possessed in his wickedness, and never acts properly
upon a selfish plan. For this reason, when we mark the many pure
and bright qualities, which might form the elements of a most noble
character, and of whose value the ingenuous owner seems hardly
conscious, we are tempted to exclaim in another sense,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O Fortunatus! sua si bona noverit!</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>And when we see these tarnished and obscured by means of deceit
which he does not comprehend, or if he does, has not sufficient energy
to dispel, though we cannot greatly respect, we can still admire
and pity him. We cannot view him with the same feelings as
we do Richard III, wholly remorseless, and self-possessed in wickedness
absolutely unredeemed; nor as we do that cool, contriving
villain, Iago. On account of his openness of mind also, his character
will be best understood, not by formal analysis, but by following
him through the various circumstances in which he is placed, and
observing their effects on a mind too genial not to receive them, and
withal too transparent to hide them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us take him then as he is first presented to us. He is a hero.
This character also remains with him throughout. It is heroism
which urges him to deeds of high daring, which prompts his mind to
its lofty conceptions of greatness, which struggles long and hard with
his conscience, but at last plunges him in guilt, propelling him deeper
and deeper into it, and called out in its utmost grandeur and intensity
in braving the cowardice of remorse. But with the hero’s
bravery and lion strength, there is united also the “milk of human
kindness,” and the tenderest pity; for who, other than he who
copied from his own breast, would have conceived of it thus, even
when it opposed directly his designs.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>And <em>pity</em>, like a <em>naked newborn babe</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Striding the blast, or heav’ns cherubim, hors’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the sightless couriers of the air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>That tears shall drown the wind.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>But above all, as a hero he “is not without ambition.” Yet he is
also “without the illness should attend it.” Naturally noble and
ingenuous, his ambition up to this time had been rather than any
thing else, an aimless, generous aspiring after that which should fill
his own capacity, and sought no other reward for manly deeds than
the doing them. It was consistent also with a state of high and pure
moral feeling, as is not that which has always an end in view, and
is always planning and plotting for it. Accordingly, we find it combined
in him with great purity and ingenuousness of heart. “What
he would highly, that would he holily.” Still it was dangerous,
and, no guide to itself, was liable to take shape and direction from
any conjunction of circumstances. Until now, however, he had
gone with it securely and uprightly. He seems to have been kept
in the path of duty and honor by the generous impulses of his nature,
and perhaps more, with his peculiar openness, by the favorable
influence of his kinsman the “good king Duncan,” whom he heartily
loves and admires.</p>

<p class='c011'>But now the trial is to come; to come too with circumstances,
and at a time exactly adapted to overcome <em>him</em>. In the midst
of an intoxicating self-complacency at his victory, a state of mind
peculiarly genial for the reception of any suggestions favoring his
promotion, he is met by three supernatural beings, (to him at
least they were such,) in whom, from childhood, he had had an
unwavering faith. That faith is confirmed by the almost instant
fulfillment of two of their predictions. The third is unavoidably
suggested to his mind as a necessary consequence. A strong conviction,
amounting to a belief of destiny, that it must be fulfilled,
seems from that time to have taken hold of his mind. And how is
it to be done. His mind shrinks with ingenuous horror from the only
way: he must <em>murder</em> the king. He strives to escape from the idea.
His mind cannot, with all its ambition, and all its heroism, look clearly
through the deed to its end. It cannot <em>see</em> in the wrong direction.
It is untaught and unskilled in the ways of cunning wickedness. He
is not sufficient master of himself to climb over the horror which rises
before him. Nor yet has he <em>energy</em> enough to get away from it.
That strong conviction of the necessity of the deed, full as much, at
least, as the desirableness of its end, still enchains him. He might
indeed have reflected that it lay with him to do it or not, but he does
not, and perhaps it was hardly to be expected that <em>he should</em>. His
ambition, which had been the habit of his life, and which he had
hitherto trusted in as his good guide, has received a direction which
he cannot change, towards a point from which he cannot divert it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>He is as it were <em>spell-bound</em>. Still he cannot consent; he even decides
not to do it. His newly-won honor, gratitude, reputation
which was most dear to him, admiration for Duncan, and pity for
him as his intended victim, all forbid. Here his wife comes in, and
by some of the finest rhetoric of sophistry, sarcasm, and rebuke for
his want of heroism, induces him to “bend himself up to the terrible
feat.” The part of the play about this crisis is peculiarly fine.
There is the dagger scene, in which conscience is seen exerting its
full sway over a mind which owns it not. In the night scene, especially,
the author seems to have exerted himself to bring in every
thing that could add to the horror of the scene. Though we are
not introduced to the murder, yet we are made so fully to participate
in the horrors of the murderer, that the effect is greater than
if it had been so. All indeed that is presented to the senses, is the
most ordinary. The scene is rendered <em>hideous</em> by the knocking at
the door, and the ill-timed jollity of the unconscious porter, more,
perhaps, than by any thing else. Of Macbeth little more need be
said, nor are we inclined to pursue the subject farther. Yet amidst
all the dark and “strange deeds,” in which his heroism and the destiny
of guilt involve him, and amidst all his desperation, he still exhibits
longings for his former state of innocence and peace. For the
murdered Duncan his feelings are none other than those of respectful
compassion. In the very midst also of his deeds of guilt, and
amidst his struggles with remorse, he reveals to his wife his anguish
with the utmost tenderness of reposing affection. These things
throw a softening over a character which would otherwise be purely
abhorrent to our feelings. The idea of fate still clings to him, and
the belief that by the murder of Duncan, he had more closely associated
himself with those hellish beings who had led him on, adds
yet another shade to the darkness of his mind. In an agony of desperation
he consults them to learn, “by the worst means the worst.”
From that hour, we feel that his doom is fixed; knowing that
though</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They “keep the words of promise to his ear,”</div>
      <div class='line'>They’ll “break it to his hope.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Thus it proves. Macbeth seeing one promise after another in which
he had trusted, failing him, at last throws himself upon his own
courage, which, as an acquired habit of the field at least, had never
left him. With sword in hand he dies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lady Macbeth, who by her amazing, and fearful energy of intellect,
could suppress remorse as long as there was any object to
be accomplished, when at length her mind is left objectless, feels it
in its most terrible power. When upon such a mind remorse fastens
its fangs, that mind turns upon its devourer with an energy strong as
its own power to grasp, and enduring as its hold. Nothing sooner
than death can end the struggle.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>And now that we are at the end of this fearful and gloomy history,
we may just review the scene. Duncan, the meek and guileless
father-king, shedding around him a cheerful, genial light! Macbeth,
growing up in that light, and promising to reflect it back on its
giver, and to add to its splendor! But that light is put out in darkness:
a more fearful darkness comes over the <em>guilty man</em>, spreading
to all about him, and gathering gloom, as we are hurried rapidly and
certainly to the consummation. At length, when virtue reappears,
though it be in the form of an avenger, the darkness begins to move
away; and light, though mild and chastened, just gilds the scene as
it closes.</p>

<p class='c011'>If I was so fortunate as to please thee with my former offering—how
shall I, as I resume my labors of this month, so weave
from the store-house of my fancy such another vision, as shall make
thee extend the hand of amity, and give me a second approving
smile. To scribble for another, when you know not his taste—to
attempt to bring out such a ‘conceit,’ as shall catch his kindness,
and hurry him along with you into good humor, has ever, since the
earliest essays in story writing, been accounted a delicate business.
And why? because what pleases you, fair lady, pleases not my fellow
student; and what pleases you, fellow student, pleases not somebody
else; so a man finds himself like the bundle of oats betwixt—no,
no! (Apollo forgive me!) I mean like the ass betwixt two bundles,
&amp;c. Washington Irving (Heaven bless him! and pardon <em>me</em>
for whipping his name into my thoughtless lucubrations) has somewhere—finding
himself in a similar predicament—made this remark;
‘if the reader find, here and there, something to please him, let him
rest assured that it was written expressly for intelligent readers like
himself; but should he find any thing to dislike, let him tolerate it,
as one of those articles which the author has been obliged to write
for readers of a less refined taste.’ Allow me to say the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>You should know, I think, by this time, that I am devoted to thy
interest, as completely so, as ever belted knight on plain of Palestine,
to his ‘ladye love,’—that my feelings and sympathies go out to thee,
as a bee to its bower, a bird to its forest-nest, or any other of the
bright creatures of God to the home of their affections—(by the by,
you may smile at this. Stop! I know you’re not my ‘ladye love,’
nor am I a bee, or a bird, or any such nonsense; but, by my ‘saying
of this simile,’ as sweet Sir Philip hath it, I meant only to apprise
thee of my extreme devotion. You understand?),—that I would
do any thing, to witch from thee, the heart-ache, even to the disquiet
of the pleasant comfortableness of one of my soft, selfish, afternoon
reveries,—that I would spend the last drop of my—no! not my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>blood exactly, for much as I love you, I love myself better; but I
mean, I would spend the last drop of my—<em>ink</em>, to please you; and
that you know is much better—for the ink of a literary man, <em>id est</em>
a poetical one, is worth more than his blood and body together.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, though I have such a love for you, it would be sad, if, like
the Paddy’s saddle-bags, it should all be found on one side; for I
can no more prosper—and, if I must confess it, can no more love you
without some remuneration, than a lover could kiss the turf on which
his mistress had stepped, or make sonnets to her eye-brows, when
she frowned on him. She is the sun of his existence, the centre, the
cynosure of his passions, hopes, and dreams—to which, through the
darkness that the world flings about him, he may send his longing
eye, and his heart’s holiest aspirations. <em>You</em> are the sun of <em>my</em> being—the
centre—cynosure—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et cetera, et cetera</span></i>; and it is equally
impossible that I can make verses and stories for you, when every
time I look up, I see that horrible scowl on your face—Pray, put it off.</p>

<p class='c011'>But I’ll not believe you hate me—and when you receive this fresh
number, and open upon this page for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morceau</span></i> I have for you, I
know ye’ll give me a pleasant smile, and, with the honest Scotchman,
say, ‘Deil! but I winna gie ither than thanks to a daft callan
like ye.’</p>

<p class='c011'>But—to business.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c011'>Talking with my friend one day on the subject of dueling, he
gave me the following story.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>THE DUEL.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>

      <div class='line in8'>‘Men should wear softer hearts,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tremble at these licens’d butcheries,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in40'><em>Bryant.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If there is one damning custom among the sons of men, ’tis dueling.
Call it not murder—willful killing is murder; but this cool,
calculating, exulting killing—killing not in madness, not in despair,
when the heart tossed on a surge of passion, strikes, and repents
next moment; but the coolly looking at the spot where the heart
lies; the putting the dagger there calculatingly; and then, instead
of pressing it home fiercely, thrusting it into the warm flesh, inch
by inch, till the hot blood spurts over the fingers, and clots on the
garments—this, what is this? Oh! call it not murder—murder is a
thing of earth—earthly passions do it. But this—go to the pit where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the damned shriek, and howl—select the most fiendish scheme of the
prince of fiends—then, and then only, shall you have a parallel.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was once my lot, to be a secondary actor, in a case of ‘honorable
butchery;’ and one so black in itself, so heart-rending in consequences,
that it is graven into my brain as with a stamp of fire. God
of Heaven! when I think of it, even at this distance of time—when
I see my friend stiff, ghastly, and stretched on the wet sands—when I
hear the groans, which I heard there—when I see innocence, beauty,
confiding affection, hanging over the yet warm corse, and pouring
forth tears, as if crushed from the bottom of a heart loaded with
the agony of ages—and then see the same creature, the inmate of
a mad-house, and hear the moans and ravings for the dead object—and,
with the peculiar characteristic of such insanity, accusing the
loved one of coldness, ingratitude, unfaithfulness, and the like,—I say
again, ages could not wipe out the recollection.</p>

<p class='c011'>You are aware, that in the southern states, especially in the extreme
south, men are guided more by their passions than at the
north,—that there, dueling is little cared for,—that courageous is he
who has shot his man,—that those only are cowards, who pale at
blood, human blood, blood shed by their own hands. In no part
of the south is this custom more prevalent, than at Natchez, on the
Mississippi. New Orleans will not compare with it, or would not in
the year 1816, the period of my story, and when I was a resident of
that place. New Orleans, bad as it is, possessing greater means of
indulgence, with its wealth to support theatres, gambling-houses,
cock-pits, horse-races, and other such amusements—with its motley
assemblage of inhabitants, Spanish, French, English, and Americans
amalgamated,—with all these, it is not so bad as Natchez; and for
this reason—that there are those, and in great numbers there, belonging
to the northern and better regulated states, from whom, an
imperceptible indeed, yet nevertheless great influence is sent into
that community, and the people with more wickedness perhaps,
have more conscience than any other of the extreme southern cities.</p>

<p class='c011'>Natchez, it will be remembered, is on the eastern side of the Mississippi,
and on one of the bends of that magnificent river, withdrawn
a little from its banks, and sloping handsomely down to its flowing
waters. Above and below the immediate town, are many eligible
and pleasant sites for country seats, should that part of the country
ever possess wealth and taste enough, to think of building them.
But at the period of my story, there was nothing of the kind. Dark
pine groves, and impenetrable thicks of beech and sycamore, with
their lofty branches intertwined in many a wild convolution, made a
high and thick canopy for the wearied traveler; while the beautiful
flowers of the region, among which was the splendid magnolia, gave
the forest, the freshness and fragrance of a lady’s flower garden.
From morn till night, the woods were alive with music, and over
all, was that sweet harmonist of nature, the American mocking-bird,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>with its rising and falling, ever-varying modulations—now screaming
like the startled vulture of the cliffs—and now sinking away with a
witching alternation of soft, plaintive, heart-moving minstrelsy, sufficient,
it would seem, to charm rocks and forest trees,—He who built
Thebes, would have thrown away his instrument in despair, could
he have heard but one note of this wild-wood melodist.</p>

<p class='c011'>I said there were no country seats there. I mistake. There was
one bright spot, about twelve miles above Natchez, which, though
it had small pretensions to the surpassing beauty of some of the
fine superstructures on these northern rivers; nevertheless, for that
day and place, it was, certainly, an elegant and hospitable mansion.
That it was hospitable, many a man, yet living, can testify—for
many were the travelers, visiting in that region, who spent days
there, and enjoyed the rich hospitality and urbane attentions of its
warm-souled, accomplished proprietor. This man, Charles Glenning,
was certainly as gentlemanly a person as I ever knew. He
was educated at the north—had spent his early days there—but for
the sake of business, to which he betook him on leaving College, he
went to the south, carrying with him as bright a bud of feminine
loveliness, as ever God suffered to bloom in this uncongenial, ugly
world. I cannot paint her—there’s no telling how beautiful she was.
It wasn’t beauty of feature; neither was it beauty of mind—and
yet, it was beauty of a high and ardent cast, which made you feel
you were in the presence of a spirit, the moment you came near
her. Forehead white as death—yet, neither intellectual nor otherwise,—soft
blue eyes, that made you think they were little pieces
cut out of the bluest summer sky,—complexion like ivory,—lips
like the finest evening tints, in the back ground of one of Claude
Lorraine’s landscapes,—and a figure as faultless as ever was hewn
from the Pentelican marble, or set a painter a dreaming over his
easel.—Imagine these, and you may get a glimpse of the laughing,
bright-eyed Isabel Glenning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her love for her husband was as strange as her beauty. O! the
treasure—the full, proud treasures of such a heart as that! Dive
into mines—bring up jewels—fill your dwelling—win sceptres—ride
the world like Cæsar or Alexander—and then offer me the pure,
deep, devoted, heart’s affection of such a spiritual creature as she
was, and I would spurn them all as the dirty commerce of dirtier
minds. She lived only for him—she dreamed only for him—he
was all. Place her in a palace, in an Esquimaux hut; in a fairyland,
in a desert; no matter where—only with him—him she had
chosen to live and die with, and her cup was full.</p>

<p class='c011'>The circumstances which led me to their acquaintance were peculiar,
and such as entwined me into their best feelings. They had
been married about four summers; and the fruits of their union, was
a little, crowing, curly headed boy, sweet as his mother’s beauty.
I was hunting on the side of the Mississippi, one warm afternoon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>when I observed something floating at a distance, which by means of
my dog, was brought to land; and, to my surprise, were presented the
lifeless, yet still warm features of this same little fellow. It seemed
that playing near the river, he had fallen in, and was near about
breathing his last. Taking him in my arms, I hurried home, and
just in time to save him. From that hour, they loved me as a
brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>My story now leads me a little from the straight track, I have
kept thus far—but ’tis necessary to turn aside a little, for the sake
of the dark catastrophe, which brought sorrow and death into this
Eden-dwelling I have described.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was one Nat. Ralle, dwelling about half way between
Natchez, and the plantation of my friend. His was one of those
dark-browed, malicious countenances, which made one, in spite of
himself, think of the devil, whenever he met him. He never spake
like other men. If you met him in the woods of a morning, his
salutation was in a low, surly tone, which made you doubtful as to
its nature; and after he had passed you for forty or fifty yards, you
might observe him stopping and looking back, as if he felt himself
suspected by every body. This devil—for such he was, and such
will he appear before I have done with him—more than once, had
been seen prowling about the dwelling of Glenning; and once, being
met suddenly, he turned and ran away into the woods, like one
of the wild beasts he so much in disposition resembled.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a custom, which yet, I believe, exists in the southwestern
new settlements, for a man to claim the exclusive privilege
of hunting on a certain extent of ground, in the vicinity of his habitation.
This right is as much insisted on, in certain parts of those
states which I have visited, as are the game laws in England; and
every one, every stranger-hunter, observes it, and recognizes the
right by quitting the grounds, so soon as informed that an individual
holds reasonable claim to them. This Ralle had, in open defiance of
this knowledge, and against the reiterated, yet polite admonitions of
Glenning, trespassed on his lands; and once shot a tame doe, which
Glenning had kept for two or three years, the care of which had
devolved on, and was a source of amusement to Isabel—and on that
account it seemed a double injury.</p>

<p class='c011'>Glenning, as cool a man as ever laid claim to the qualities of
honor and honesty, at this, rode down to the plantation of Ralle,
and mildly, yet earnestly, expostulated with him, on what was esteemed
a breach of faith—careful at the same time to express his
belief, that the shooting of his tame animal was undesigned, yet
requesting, for fear of a similar occurrence, that he would hunt elsewhere
in future, which thing he could do without incommoding
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>To this mildness in Glenning, Ralle opposed the remark—‘That
he would do as he pleased—that the woods were free, and that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>should hunt towards the north or south, without asking leave of
Yankee interlopers.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This remark struck on the temper of Glenning, at an unlucky moment.
The very consciousness of rectitude on his own part, made
the insult fasten and rankle; and gave to it a barb, which, perhaps,
in any other circumstances, would not have pained him. Glenning,
I have said, was a gentleman. He was such, if there ever was one—a
man of good morals, charitable in his disposition, and could not
bear to inflict pain, even on a dumb beast. But there is, within the
human heart—and philosophy may reason it over till doomsday, without
explaining it—a something to quiet conscience, even in the best
men, at times, and force them to acts, which in other circumstances
they would shudder at. Dueling is one of them. Dueling, Glenning
despised from his soul. I have heard him say so a thousand
times, and sternly express his abhorrence of the man who could
stain his hands with a fellow’s blood. He even rose once, and left
an agreeable company, because he was told that such a gentleman
present was a duelist. With such notions—and they were not mere
talk with him—it is a thing I cannot explain, that he so far forgot
himself as to hurl back the insult he had received, and in a manner
calculated to lead to so sad a termination. He did so, however, and
retort calling forth retort, they both lost their tempers—when, Ralle
springing forward with a knife, Glenning knocked him down with
the butt of his whip. He then turned and rode home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel met him at the door, and it needed but a glance to see that
something was the matter. His brow was knit—his teeth set like a
vise—and his lip curled with a stern haughtiness, which I had never
supposed was in him before.</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to pass her. Isabel threw her arms about him, and burst
into tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>It awoke him—his happiness came back to his heart—the fiend
fled from him—and he stood in the presence of that lovely, simple-hearted
weeper, as helpless as a child. The effect of his passions
unnerved him, like a fever; and he was forced to keep his chamber
till evening. He then entered the parlor again.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the fond inquisitiveness of Isabel, he now opposed, the heat
of the weather, the weariness of his long ride, and some other little
nothings; and by his wit, and pleasantry, succeeded in lulling her
into a forgetfulness of the events of the day. O! that was a calm—a
deep and awful calm. It was that which precedes the thunder—the
moment between the flash and the bolt,—<em>And the bolt came</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>I had seen a messenger approach, and leave the gate at sun-set;
and had suspicions, more than I dared acknowledge to myself. And
yet, my friend was never more agreeable, than on that evening. It
seemed as if some unheard of powers had been given him. Skilled
in metaphysics—for they had amused him much at College—and,
well acquainted with the principles, and history of the Fine Arts, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>rambled from one to the other, with the most amusing madness—sometimes
serious, sometimes turning a happy illustration into the
most exquisite ridicule by some keen stroke of humor, and now
running off again, in a manner at once new and electrifying. He
was, on the whole, the most amusing man, for the time, I ever spent
an evening with. Poor, poor Glenning!—but I will not anticipate.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the evening closed, he followed me into my room; and,
locking the door, sat down, and wept like a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Poor, poor Isabel!’ was all he could articulate. ‘She suspects
nothing, poor thing—and it will break her heart. Death,’ cried
he, starting up, ‘I fear it not. I have lived to die when my time
comes. But she—she who loves me—whose life is wrapped up in
mine—how can she’—and sinking down, he wept longer than before.</p>

<p class='c011'>I ventured to lay my hand on his shoulder. He rose calm, awfully
calm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grasping my hand, ‘my friend,’ said he—‘you must help me
in this. You must stand by, and see me fall, if fall I must; and
then—bear the news to—to—’ his sobbing choak’d his utterance.</p>

<p class='c011'>I asked him if there were no means of avoiding it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘None—none in the world.’ He said this in a tone, which forbade
argument: and I said no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>I draw a veil over the remainder of that evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the sun, he met me at the bottom of the hill in front of his
dwelling, with his pistols in his hand. He requested me to load
them. I did so, and without a muscle’s shaking; for from my childhood,
I had been incapable of every kind of fear; nevertheless, I
thought of the form which might be stiff before evening—of eyes
that might be glazed—and of the fond heart which I knew <em>would</em> be
broken.</p>

<p class='c011'>He told me he had left his wife sleeping: and as he hung over
her, and kissed those lips, the music of which he might hear no longer,
she breathed his name in her slumbers. ‘That—that parting’—and
he grasped my hand, with an energy sufficient to crush
it—‘that parting,’ said he, ‘has killed me. I cannot feel worse.
No! not if I felt my adversary’s bullet in my heart, could I feel
worse. And she—O! who will take care of her? who will dry her
tears? who bind up that heart, which will certainly break with
mine?’</p>

<p class='c011'>He gave way but a moment to feelings of this nature; for, commending
her to me in case of his death, he walked forward to the
place agreed on, with the most perfect calmness. All the difference
to be observed in him was, perchance, a degree of paleness;
nothing else betrayed the fact, that he was walking to his grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place selected for the rencontre, was a wild and beaten spot
on the river-shore, where the rocks, rising abruptly to the altitude of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>some hundred feet, swept round like a horse shoe in two projections,
and then thrust themselves into the stream, leaving a hollow
curve of smooth wet sand within them, of about three rods in length.
The beach was white as snow, the blue waters of the Mississippi
went by with a low groaning sound, the hoarse screaming of the
flamingo swept out from the rocks overhead, and the sun was just
blazing out from the lazy mists of the morning, as the party entered.</p>

<p class='c011'>I shall never forget how the combatants looked, at that moment.
Glenning was calm, stern, and sorrowful—Ralle looked like a devil.
He scowled horridly, as he marked the tall, handsome figure of his
adversary; and seemed joyed that he had it in his power, to spoil
such a fine piece of God’s workmanship.</p>

<p class='c011'>I approached Glenning, and asked his wishes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<em>I am ready</em>’—were his words.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pistols were placed in their hands. They fired—my friend
into the air—Ralle with a steady aim; yet his ball whistled harmlessly
by, and lodged in the opposite rocks.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘What’s to be done?’ said Ralle’s second.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘If Mr. Glenning will acknowledge himself a coward,’ said Ralle
in a low, taunting tone, ‘and ask my forgiveness, he may go about
his business.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Never, wretch!—reload the pistols.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The pistols were again placed in their hands, and they fired; as
before, Glenning into the air—Ralle’s ball passing harmlessly by.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man again interfered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ralle made the same remark.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Silence!’ thundered Glenning, ‘thou bloody villain, nor dare
insult the ears of manhood, by your damning proposition. I should
prove myself a liar did I do it; you, you gave the offence, and ’tis
from you should come the acknowledgment. But this is wasting
time. That I am no coward, sir, I have fully shown by twice
withstanding your fire. Now ’tis my turn—give us the pistols.
Wretch,’—cried he, looking on Ralle with eyes flashing intolerably
bright, and voice so hoarse that it could scarcely be heard—‘wretch!
you have lived too long. I would not stain my hands,
but I shall bless the world, by ridding it of you. Look your last on
the sun—for, by the Eternal God! you certainly die.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The pistols were handed them—the word given; this time, my
friend aimed and fired. Ralle staggered back, and fell upon his
knees; yet, he soon recovered himself, and rising to his feet, he certainly
presented the most horrible countenance I ever saw. The
ball had struck him on the jaw near the ear, and crushed it to atoms;
and the blood spirted over him from head to foot. He uttered
one dreadful shriek of agony; then—before I could interfere, rushed
up, presented his pistol at the breast of Glenning, and shot him
through the heart.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Such a dastard act!—But let me close the scene. I have dwelt
on it too long. We carried my friend to his dwelling—we tore open
his garments—there was the ragged wound in his breast, and his
heart’s blood gushing through it.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c011'>Poor, poor Isabel! she sleeps beneath the flowers she so much
resembled—her name is left in our hearts.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Reader! if thou art one from whose mind all that is native in
modesty or sentiment, has not been supplanted by that refined impudence
so much in vogue—that fashionable insensibility, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——“mortal coldness of the soul like death itself,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>I demand your sympathy with the thoughts, the emotions, the sorrows
of a Sensitive Man. My earliest recollections are connected
with acute suffering from an extreme modesty and diffidence, which
ever has been, and ever will be, the bane of my spirits. A page
from my life will reveal its nature. Those who have cast an eye
over a previous article with the above title, will have learnt something
of the bigotry and vulgarity of Droneville. It was blessed,
however, with one family, of a higher and nobler order than the
barbarians around them—beings, who, having walked forth into the
world, had lost that narrowness of intellect, which distinguished the
Dronevillites from the rest of mankind. The E—— family were
the aristocracy of Droneville. C—— E—— was the companion
of my earliest pleasures—the sharer of my earliest affections. We
were inseparable friends—we walked together—we played together,
and breast to breast severely drubbed the insolent urchin who dared
assail our mutual honor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hope E——! What a scourge wert thou to every bashful
youngster! There was a laughing deviltry in thy eye, which threw
mine into a sudden gaze upon vacuity, or inspired an irresistible desire
to examine my feet—while a deepening flush of the cheeks proclaimed
the intensity of my curiosity! Never were there eyes more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>keen in detecting the occasional spots which diversify the face of
boyhood—in discovering whose hands water would not sully—whose
locks the fingers of the friseur might improve. Her laugh was the
terror of every bashful youth—it was the signal of his discomfiture—it
rang in his ears when alone—it haunted his fancy—it mingled
with his dreams. Hope E——, thou torment of my early years!
No artifice could hide from thy searching gaze any blemish of person
or dress, which my pride or modesty was desirous of concealing. If
my face was soiled—if there was a puncture in the elbow of my
coat, thy laugh would first announce it. Any unfortunate rent in
my nether integuments, was sure of detection, although every possible
means was used to conceal it, and that laugh—that wild, gleeful
laugh, would summon the eager gaze of all to thine embarrassed victim!
My highest audacity could never encounter her eyes; they
alone were enough to drive mad a modest youth. And yet I could
not avoid them, for in spite of myself, mine were constantly straying
in that direction, drawn thitherward by an impulse beyond the control
of my will—the nature of which my philosophy has never yet
unravelled. Believe me, that in all my visits to her brother, I
avoided her with a dexterity, worthy the skill of the most finished
adept in the fashionable art of “cutting acquaintance.” But it was
vain to struggle against destiny. Poor C——! my bosom’s earliest
friend—his mother’s hope—died—suddenly died in the first bloom
of youth! How thrilled my young heart, as I knelt by his bedside,
and caught from his dying lips a whispered farewell! He died—but,
can death destroy a mother’s love? To me was transferred a
portion of that deep, gushing affection, which had been thus suddenly
driven back upon its source. A week elapsed—and I was summoned
to an interview with Mrs. E——. What an invitation for a
bashful youth! My heart forboded approaching calamity—it blenched
like a wounded man—it already felt the glance of Hope—it
trembled at the anticipation of her laugh. But there could be no
demur—there was no escape—I <em>must</em> go. View me there, “creeping
like snail unwillingly,” over the small grass plot which separated
our dwellings—kicking every stone and mushroom upon my path—“screwing
up” my courage to an effort the most desperate, it had
ever yet been called upon to sustain. I finally succeeded—gained
the door—hesitated—my resolution failed—it rallied, and I entered
the parlor with all the grace of attitude and mien, which may be observed
in a detected sheep-stealer. Hope and her mother were
there. I had scarcely made this observation, when I was enfolded in
an embrace, nerved by all the fearful energies of a mother’s love!
In a paroxysm of mingled grief and affection, she covered my face
with the kisses and tears of an overflowing heart. But forget not
me. What a predicament! Reader, art thou a bashful man? I
ask your sympathy, I claim your advice. What would <em>you</em> have
done? What could <em>I</em> do, but stand, perspiring with the intensity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>my embarrassment—desperately clenching, with both hands, my
hat—bracing my nerves to endurance—my eyes downcast with
shame—my face burning with blushes—modesty personified! When
this first outbreaking of maternal love had subsided, I stood in trembling
expectation of its renewal. I durst not look up, for the eyes
of Hope, swimming with suppressed mirth, at my ludicrous appearance,
tortured even my fancy. A long struggle gave me the requisite
courage to cast, from the corner of my eye, a timid glance towards
her. I ventured to hope that the worst was over. Alas!
how delusive! woes come not single. My eye no sooner met hers,
than she—moved by sympathy, or one of the thousand impulses of
passion or caprice which govern the actions of the fair, or something
else, (I am no philosopher,)—rushed towards me, threw her arms
convulsively around my neck, and with kisses and tears did admirable
honor to the maternal example! Could a bashful youth endure
this—be clasped in the arms of her he feared, yet loved—could he
experience this, and survive the shock? I rushed in agony from
the room, nor slackened my career, until I had buried my head in
the recesses of my own solitary chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Hope! poor Hope! she died within a year.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c011'>Years have rolled away, and the marks of manhood now darken
his cheek, which once kindled under the glance of Hope E——.
But the lapse of time has not—can not—change the peculiarities of
his mind; he lived constantly in Droneville—he never mingled with
society, and that youthful diffidence which maturer years wears off
from the minds of others, was in his deepened into an exquisite sensitiveness,
which draws from the slightest ridicule or neglect materials
for self-torture. The sarcasm which glides from the ears of the
giddy—the glance of indifference or scorn, unfelt by the votary of
fashion, gains a lodgment in his breast, and for weeks, yes, months,
preys upon its peace. He hears the laugh of the incredulous, the
sneer of the cynic, the aphorism of the moralist, but neither, nor all,
can drive from its lair this demon within him,—it is inwrought with
the very texture of his soul—it is a part of its undying essence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ye who can feel for others’ woes, imagine the sufferings of a mind
thus strung, yet branded with all the rusticity of Droneville manners,
exposed to the taunts and ridicule of College life. View him,
the butt of sarcasm—the mark of scorn—the bound, the unarmed
victim, against whose breast all aspirant wits may with impunity
test the point of every weapon, and their own dexterity in its use.
My Droneville education! It has been a “heritage of woe”—a
source of the deepest, acutest suffering. In manners, in appearance,
in every thing which the cant of society calls “elegance,” I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>was not only entirely deficient, but so absolutely clownish as to elicit
wit from stupidity itself. Follow such an one, forced by circumstances
beyond his control into the cold world of fashion, and your
fancy can picture those scenes of embarrassment and humiliation,
which my memory shrinks from recalling. And yet, my mind—<em>my
mind</em> was of no such ungainly mould. If this clay was thrown
amidst the stock of Droneville, it had been fired by an intellect
whose boundless aspirations scorned all limit or control. What if it
<em>did</em> know nought of the refinements of artificial life? From the
mountain solitude—from the heavens above—from the earth, in its
sublimity—from the whisperings of its own spirit, it had drawn in
all that is deep in emotion or thrilling in thought. If it <em>was</em> a stranger
to society, it was no stranger to the greatest minds of the present
and past ages. It requires not the formalities of fashion—none of
the coxcomb’s art—to hold communion with this ethereal principle
within us—to dwell with the genius of the mighty Past—to soar
amidst the high hopes of the Future—to love and worship those
beings with whom imagination peoples her own brilliant creations.
Must I be a scorned outcast, neglected by my race, because this
perishable clay was not moulded in that form, which might please
the evanescent fancy? because my limbs would not play the buffoon
at the beck of fashion, or my tongue utter, or my spirit endure, her
language of emptiness and deceit? A misanthrope? <em>no!</em> I scorn
that name, but scorn more him who covets the reputation or affects
the spirit of misanthropy. A misanthrope! never. The source of
my suffering was a consciousness of a deep fountain of feeling—of
love, (if you please,) without one being upon whom I could lavish
it; for who would deign to accept the devotion of a clown?—it was
too much to ask of any one’s benevolence. Can there be one more
unfortunate? Is there suffering more intense, than that of a being
conscious of mental power, infinitely superior to the butterflies of
fashion—glowing with all that is rich in thought, or deathless in
love—a love, which, squandering on its object entire devotion, stoops
to no barter of affection but soul for soul—yet, having all its energies
paralyzed by a sense of awkwardness—a serpent whose folds are
drawn tauter by his very struggles to resist them. Place such a
mind, keenly sensitive to ridicule or neglect, in the gay saloon; with
all his intellect he feels himself a mark for the sarcasm of the most
insignificant. He can neither move, nor speak, and while his heart
is overflowing with emotion, he is scorned as an unfeeling brute!
No one cares for him—no one knows his sorrows—no eye</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in32'>“will mark</div>
      <div class='line'><em>His</em> coming, and look brighter when <em>he</em> comes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The joyful faces around him—the gay laugh ringing in his ears—the
warm kiss of affection—the soft whisper of love—all, <em>all</em> reveal the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>solitude, the hopelessness of his lot. How often have I been thus
placed! How often, as I have stood, hour after hour, silent <em>and
alone</em>, amidst a crowd of my species, have I thought, that a whole
life’s love would not recompense one glance of remembrance—one
word of welcome! All this too, while I have seen the selfish caressed—the
ignorant flattered, and quailed beneath the eye of those,
whom, if met upon the arena of mind, I could have crushed. But
I have suffered most deeply, most keenly, from those in whose gratitude,
at least, I had reposed some confidence. If there be one
crime—<em>one</em> of guilt so unmitigated as to wake the thunderbolt, as
to call down retributive justice—it is that viper, ingratitude. No
exertion of <em>human</em> power can suppress it, laws cannot define it, penalties
cannot reach it;—the law of love, that last hope of virtue, is
powerless here. And yet, it is a crime which would drive all joy
from earth—it would crush all that is holy in the heart—it would
dissever man from his species.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the eye of one after another has lighted upon me, and turned
scornfully from the uncouth clown before them, I have prayed—yes,
prayed—it could not be impious—that their vision might for one instant
be quickened, so as to penetrate the mind. It is too much to
hope for <em>here</em>,—but</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“If there be, indeed,</div>

      <div class='line'>All unincorporate.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We can bear the scorn of man, cold, selfish man, for there is
something in the insolent boldness of his sneer, which nerves the
heart to endurance, or wakes the slumber of revenge; but the contumely
of those, from whose nature’s tenderness, we might have expected
pity at least, disarms all resistance. It is as if the elements
conspired against you; it sends through the heart a sort of “et tu
Brute” feeling, which imparts to it a desperate resignation to fate;
this, this burns the brand which shuts out the victim from the sympathy
of his race! I once thought that the contempt of all—the
ridicule of inferiors—the ingratitude of friends, had steeled my heart
to the most cutting scorn; but I lived to learn that there was a chord,
deep in the recesses, which could only be reached by the dextrous
hand of her who was worshipped there with a whole soul’s devotion.
Even <em>her</em> lip curled with disgust, as she turned contemptuously from
me to listen to the voice of flattery. Censure her not—she is admired
by all—she was never friendless—will she ever know how
deep, how exhaustless is a rustic’s love? How often, as he has returned
from gazing hours upon <em>her</em> who deigned him not one glance
in return, has the heart of the clown flowed forth, if not in the spirit
of poetry, at least with that of sincerity.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>I gazed on thee, dear one, in the crowd of the gay,</div>

      <div class='line'>My bosom a hope like the martyr’s of heaven;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the eye which could gladden, was chilling with scorn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a heart-nurtured rose is changed to a thorn.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I gazed on thee, dear one—’twas a moment that thought</div>
      <div class='line'>Had eagerly, hopefully, doubtingly sought;</div>
      <div class='line'>I did meet thee, I left thee, and <em>thou</em> didst not know,</div>
      <div class='line'>That on thy lip quivered my joy or my woe;</div>
      <div class='line'>When I looked but for pity, thy scorn could I bear?—</div>
      <div class='line'>My hopes have all withered, my doubts are despair.</div>

      <div class='line'>If sorrow—shall I wish it?—should ever reveal,</div>

      <div class='line'>If in a lone moment a wish should come o’er thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>For one who can love—yes, dear one, adore thee;—</div>
      <div class='line'>My heart never changes—tell me, dearest, can thine</div>
      <div class='line'>E’er love with an ardor so deathless as mine?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Is it surprising, that such an experience, acting upon such a temperament,
has driven me from society, not as a misanthrope—not as
a misogynist, but as a cold intellectualist. I must henceforth look
for my enjoyment to the abstract pleasures of the understanding.
A heart which was formed to open and expand in the atmosphere
which gladdens the fireside, must stifle its emotions in the bustle of
political life, in the fierce encounter of contending minds, or in the
endless, absorbing pursuit of gain. I must hereafter dissever the
mind from the heart, and content myself with being the civilized
savage, which all men would have been, if woman had never existed,
or if the religion she reveres had never exalted her character.
For with all his boasting, what is man’s mind, without <em>her</em> influence?
It is like the rough sketch of the painter, in which the prominent
parts only are developed. As it requires the utmost refinement of
his art, to give these rugged outlines grace and beauty, to call into
being the living landscape and the speaking eye; thus it is, beautifully,
the part of woman, to fill out the rugged outlines of man’s
mind, with those refined virtues, which embellish his character. It
is for her to touch with the radiance of Mercy, the stern lineaments
of Justice; she must shade away Ferocity, with the tints of Mildness;
she must hide every blemish, with the coloring of her own
purity; she must brighten every dark spot, with the brilliancy of her
own innocence; she must throw over the roughness of the whole,
the magic of her own refined sensibility.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such has been the experience of a Sensitive Man: it is not without
a moral for those who are not too wise to learn from the errors
of others.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>REVIEW.<br /> <span class='large'><em>“The Partisan,” a Tale of the Revolution. By the author of “The Yemassee,” “Guy Rivers,” &amp;c.</em></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There are two ways of acquiring literary reputation—the one is
by an author’s <em>real merits</em>, the other by his <em>puffs</em>. Of the former
method nothing need be said, but the latter merits the severest censure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Puffs, have become the publisher’s, and in a great degree the
author’s, living. So completely is it the publisher’s trade, and so
firm withal is his hold upon the nose of that stupid <em>gull</em>, the public,
that he can make a book, which contains one page that will be read
in a newspaper, as an extract, “the best novel of the season,” and
can exalt “the most stupid ass that brays on paper,” to a place
“among our first novelists.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Authorship has, in fact, become a <em>trade</em>. The writer presents his
manuscript to the publisher, with information that another novel is
in the works. The latter prints it, and sends it forth, with a few
feeble puffs, “damning with faint praise,” and the poor bantling,
fathered by a head without brains, is worse than still-born. But the
parties concerned are not a whit uneasy; they know of a revivifying
principle, <em>all</em> powerful. In a short time, another work is announced,
by the same author. Now all is “ripe for the harvest.” The well
paid journals and periodicals are loud in their praises. “This work
fully answers the high expectations raised by the author’s first production.
The uncommon genius and talents displayed in that, led
us to expect nothing less than the work before us. Owing to the
author’s want of celebrity, his first effort did not meet with the success
which those acquainted with its merits had anticipated. This
might have discouraged a genius of lower order, and less conscious
of its powers, but the second trial promises an ample reward for
both—in fame, as well as profit.” The scheme works. The greedy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>public swallow the dose, and smack their lips—for they are <em>told</em> that
it is good. Both of the works go off with a rapid sale, and the
author is now sure of reaping profit, and, for the time, fame, from
whatever trash he inflicts upon the community, for “his name is
among our first novelists,” and he himself puts on “the distant air
of greatness,” puffed into the belief that he is a genius.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is labor most <em>unproductive</em> to the country. It is but forging
titles to literary fame,—it is climbing in some other way than by the
door of merit,—a practice most disgraceful in itself, and most poisonous
to our literature and literary reputation. This latter effect
is full obvious, for the system brings dullness to an equality with genius
and merit, and even gives it an advantage over them. They
will not stoop to such means for success, but shrink back disgusted
and discouraged, unable to compete with their inferior rival. It
could not have been a rival of itself, but, backed by such base allies,
<em>dullness</em> becomes too strong for the single arm of <em>genius</em>. Nor is
this all. We have spoken chiefly with reference to novels and novelists.
Novels supply much of the reading of youth, and by them,
therefore, in a great degree, the taste of the young is formed. Their
own judgment is not ripe, and youth rely upon that of others, to furnish
suitable models of taste. By the recommendations of those who
should be judges, they are too apt to adopt the trash with which the
press is teeming, and their judgment is affected and taste formed by
its influence. Not only their style, but the mind itself is affected.
False standards of literary merit arise, and literature itself must become
corrupt. As the country is young, and our literature forming,
those who are readers now, will soon become writers,—theirs will be
the pens, which shall, in no small degree, give us literary character,
and every taste and style thus perverted, will by so much detract
from our reputation. The evil is one, therefore, which every literary
man, who desires for our country a literary renown of which she
may be proud, should be active in subduing, lest our fame be sacrificed
to the <em>money speculations</em> of the selfish.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the authors, who, with their works, have been puffed into
notoriety, the author of “Martin Faber,” “Guy Rivers,” “The Yemassee,”
and last of all, “The Partisan,” stands conspicuous. It
may be said, that this is a bold assertion to make of a popular writer.
It certainly would be, if we did not know that popularity is no
sure test of merit.</p>

<p class='c011'>When “Guy Rivers, a tale of Georgia,” by the author of “Martin
Faber, the story of a criminal,” was announced, although we had
never before heard of this same “story of a criminal,” yet such
hearty praises accompanied the announcement, that we hoped indeed
another Cooper had raised the “torch of genius,” and was about to
dazzle the world with its rays. An enthusiast in our wishes for the
glory of American literature, we were delighted with the prospect,
and eagerly sought to complete our happiness by perusing the promising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>volumes. We read and were not satisfied, yet looked forward
for better things; for we had noted the motto of the book—</p>

<p class='c012'>We finished, and were disappointed. We had expected something
of genius—the rich, fervid style—the original thought—the bright
and glowing paintings of natural beauty, or the thrilling description
of high-wrought human energies, that stirs the soul. These we
found not, and then we waited for the cunning delineation of the human
heart—its workings, and—the “sequel.” Our reward was the
“unvarnished tale.” The work bears no mark of a mind capable of
original conceptions. The descriptions of natural scenery, throughout
this and all the author’s works, are but imitations of the works
of masters, served up in dim and changed colors. The thoughts
are trite; and the sample piece, the tit-bit, that was served up to
<em>water</em> the mouth of the public—we mean the description of the destruction
of the Georgia guard, which occupies by far the fairest
page of the work—is but a scene familiar in plot and story. Guy
Rivers himself is but a sorry deformity of one of those dark spirits,
which require the genius of a Byron or Bulwer to throw an interest
around them, and the hero has hardly a character. We can only
conceive of him as a love-sick somebody, to whom is given the name
of Ralph Colleton.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next work dealt out to the public is “The Yemassee,” and
to this we can only afford a passing remark, as our principal business
is with “The Partisan.” “The Yemassee” is the best production
of this author. When speaking of the <em>best</em> of such works, we mean
it has the fewest faults. The author advertises that he shall insist
upon its being considered a <em>romance</em>, and (as near as we can gather
from his remarks) that he has a right to say and do as he chooses.
Some of the scenes might have been made exciting, did it not seem
that the writer had measured his paper, and said “this description
shall fill <em>so much</em>.” It might be read with some interest, perhaps,
by one who had never read “The Last of the Mohicans.” But
those who have, should wait until the memory of the latter has become
faded and dim. There is enough in the story, to have made
a pretty tale of fifty pages; at least, it then would have had one
merit, which now it has not—brevity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last production from the pen of this author is “The Partisan,
a tale of the Revolution.” As the author is very particular,
and at times a little dictatorial in his <em>advertisements</em>, let us look
there for what he promises, and then examine the tale for the fulfillment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The title of the work, indeed, will persuade the reader to look
rather for a true description of that mode of warfare, (the partisan,)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>than for any consecutive story, comprising the fortunes of a single
personage. This he is solicited to keep in mind.” Again, “I
have entitled it ‘The Partisan, a tale of the Revolution’—it was
intended to be particularly such. The characters, many of them
are names in the nation, familiar as our thoughts; [the author’s
thoughts are very familiar.] Gates, Marion, De Kalb, and the rest,
are all the property of our country.” He says, “My aim has been
to give a story of events, rather than of persons”—that “A sober
desire for history—the unwritten, the unconsidered, but veracious
history—has been with me, in this labor, a sort of principle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What, then, are we to presume from this, is to be the character of
the work? Certainly, that it is to be almost entirely historical. Yet
as it is entitled a tale, we might of course suppose that the fortunes
of some individual, a fictitious person or one little known, was to be
the <em>chain</em>, into which should be woven the adventures of the famous
men—Marion, De Kalb, and others, whose names the author
mentions. It is to be “a story of events, rather than of persons.”
And what does the work prove to be? Not an event, in which
either of these Generals was active, or in any great degree interested,
is mentioned, except what is related in some of the one hundred
pages, devoted to describing the battle and defeat of Gates by Cornwallis,
which pages are almost the last of the work. To bring in
this event, the author makes a long march with his hero, who, after
all, was not engaged in the action. The story does not naturally
bring us there: so, after all, it is only by a <em>forced march</em>, that any
of the characters, set before us in the advertisement, are introduced.
His censures upon Gates are severe. Since the laurels, won at Saratoga,
were shed in the flight from Camden, that General has never
been a favorite with his countrymen. There never were wanting
hands to use the dagger against the fame of the fallen great; yet
those are not to be envied, who thus can stab the slain.</p>

<p class='c011'>We may now ask, are all the author’s promises but so much
“ado about nothing?” Let us see, by examining further. The
principal characters are, Major Singleton, the hero and ‘Partisan,’
an officer under Marion; Colonel Walton, uncle to the
‘hero,’ and father to the heroine; Dick Humphries, a co-partisan;
and John Davis, the at first unsuccessful rival of a British sergeant,
who is in love with the sister of Humphries. Besides these, there
are a number of lesser characters, who figure not a little. The
most conspicuous of these are, a mad man or devil-maniac, who has
a most outlandish habit of haw-hawing, after the manner of <em>a wolf</em>,
about his wife, who has been murdered most cruelly by the tories:
his name is Frampton—and the glutton Porgy, who helps the author
to no small quantity of matter, for filling his pages, while he
helps himself, to fill his stomach. The female characters are, Katherine
Walton,—the hero’s sister, Emily Singleton; and Bella Humphries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>These are the principal <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</span></i>; of course, there
are the <em>soldiers</em>, <em>attendants</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story, which is without a plot, (and in this I suppose the great
difference consists between a “history of events,” and novels generally,)
amounts about to this: The hero is introduced towards the
close of the day, makes one proselyte—John Davis—meets Humphries,
and with him goes by night to the “Cypress Swamp;” in
the morning suppresses with his “<em>swamp suckers</em>,” a party of tories,
which had been sent against them; after which they cut off a supply
of provisions, &amp;c., destined for the camp of the enemy: then,
placing his camp near the plantation of his uncle, he starts at night,
and, with Humphries, visits “the Oaks,” the dwelling place of Col.
Walton, and arriving, finds that Col. Proctor, who has also a love
for the daughter of the Colonel, is already there; so, hiding in “the
Oaks,” he overhears some conversation between the British officer
and Kate, who are walking with Col. Walton and the sister, which
conversation makes our hero feel better; and when the British officer
is gone, the hiders come forth, and with their friends enter the
mansion, make a visit, and shortly return to the camp; encounter
a hurricane; meet Goggle, one of the tory prisoners, whom
they had taken in the morning, and who had enlisted with them,
and now escaped; and, after endeavoring in vain to take him, they
pay a visit to his witch mother, all for no purpose; and finally reach
their camp; while Goggle goes to his mother, and sends her to Proctor
with information, and then returns to the camp of the “Partisan;”
and this finishes the first volume, so far as the principal character
is concerned.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the second volume, our hero again visits “the Oaks,” and
while standing by the bed side of his dying sister, is informed that
Proctor, with a company of soldiers, has arrived; he refuses to fly
at first, but at last escapes from the window, is pursued, and nearly
taken, but escapes, and the next moment meets Col. Walton with a
troop, the Colonel having been forced to take up arms for or against
his country: they turn, take Proctor, let him go; and the next day
our hero goes to join Marion, while Col. Walton joins Gates; and
on his way, Singleton surprises Gaskens, a tory leader, with his party;
Gates refusing to accept the proffered aid of Marion, the latter
General, with our hero, departs; the battle is fought, Col. Walton
taken, and carried to Dorchester, to be tried and executed, but is
rescued at the scaffold by Singleton, who thus wins cousin Kate,
and marries her <em>we suppose</em>, for the author leaves us in the dark as
to the “consummation most devoutly to be wished for.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This is the outline, and we will now examine parts more minutely.
The author, in the first thirty pages, proceeds to introduce the
hero to the reader, in the bar-room of the “Royal George” at
Dorchester, which “belongs to Ashley no longer,” and gives a tedious
account of sundry <em>bullyings</em> and threats, between the two rivals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Sergeant Hastings and John Davis, a doughty Goose-creeker,
which ended without many blows, thanks to the benign influence of
the pretty bar maid, whose influence seems directly the reverse of
the heifer in Virgil’s Comparison. The next thirty pages bring
our hero to the swamp, and on the ride thither, Humphries gives a
learned disquisition upon the manner of building causeways through
the swamp, which he proves most conclusively should be built
with a “back bone,” and logs placed “up and down the road.”
In the following, we have a description of some twenty men, who
are under arms in the swamp. “The gloomy painter would have
done much with the scene before them,” says our author. Would
that the gloomy painter <em>had</em> done it, or some one, who would have
done more in fewer words. It is a fault with this author, as it is
with all who have a lack of genius or vivid imagination, that, instead
of seizing upon the prominent and striking points in a scene, and
sketching them with a bold hand, leaving the picture to be filled out
by the awakened imagination of the reader, he tires, by giving minute
descriptions of every tree, grape vine, and pool of water, and
the appearance and position of each individual, as if all-important to
the “story,” as well as to the mind of the reader. As the surprize
of the tories is the first thing like an incident, that we find in the
work, although we are through with half of the first volume, was
this one of even common interest, it should be here transcribed,
but it is too prolix, and the most of it is the chase of Frampton,
the maniac, after a hang-man tory corporal, who at length became
dreadfully <em>bit</em> by the maniac’s sword. The rest of the work has
little more of interest, than that which we have thus seen: it is all
the transactions of a few men in a swamp, to illustrate the partisan
warfare in the south, without interest or useful information. The
work is made up of these <em>illustrations</em>, and the trivial adventures
of an individual. There is nothing startling enough to please, or
to excite but a drowsy interest. Notwithstanding the author tells
us that it is his aim “to delineate with all the rapidity of one, who,
with the mystic lantern, runs his uncouth shapes and varying shadows
along the gloomy wall, startling imagination, and enkindling
curiosity,” his delineations are slow, and imagination and curiosity
are left to their slumbers. The author who promises a novel purely
historical, in which true history is his chief object, promises much—such
promises it requires no ordinary mind to fulfill; and the work
before us must be looked upon only as a novel—one, in which fiction,
as usual, supplies most of the material.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this, as in the other works of this author, there is shown the
want of all those powers which mark genius. It has no deeply
drawn characters, no marks of deep insight into the human heart.
There is nothing about the hero, that should set him apart from
other men in his vocation; and Col. Walton, with a weakness that
seems like dotage, although he is in the prime of life, hesitates long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>between private interest and patriotism; and is at last <em>driven</em> to side
with his country—a character despised to the last—a lie upon the
high minded patriots of the south, who staked their princely fortunes
and their lives, in the cause of freedom. The other characters, by
which the author has endeavored to excite a higher interest, are
Frampton and Porgy. Both are failures, and the most accurate
idea we get of the latter, is where he is turned <em>grunter</em>, to catch
three terrapins, that are “<em>basking</em> in the starlight,” upon a tree
that has fallen into the creek. Mr. Simms should never again attempt
wit, or humor, unless when he is dealing with the negro
character, in which he sometimes succeeds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kate Walton is a high minded girl enough. We see but little of
her; but she should not have aimed the pistol at Col. Proctor; and
when she snapped it, the weapon should not have missed fire. Singleton
shows little sense of propriety, not to speak of affection,
when he pressed his suit the moment after leaving the bedside of
his dying sister; and the girl rebukes him well: “How can you
know it—how can you feel it, Robert, when you come from the
presence of one already linked, as it were, with heaven, and thus
immediately urge to me so earthly a prayer?” Emily Singleton—the
fading flower—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There is a beauty in woman’s decay;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>and no one,—the coldest hearted, cannot contemplate the scene—a
lovely woman, looking her last upon her existence here—“a flower
gathered for the tomb,” ere the sweet bud is fully opened—without
being excited to feeling. The death bed scene is affecting, and well
portrayed. That, and the description of the hurricane, are almost
the only parts of the work that command our feelings or admiration,
and the rude entrance of a stranger jars harshly upon us, and turns
our sympathies to hate against the intruder.</p>

<p class='c011'>This author has few beauties of style—we believe that those who
have praised him most, have ventured only <em>to be silent</em> concerning
this. There are no beauties of this description, to atone for want of
incident; nothing in the manner, to charm us into indifference to
the matter; and those who pretend to admire his writings the most,
cannot point out in them all, one sentence that contains peculiar
beauty, or originality of thought or expression. Mr. Simms at best
is but an imitator. His characters, so far as he delineates them, are
familiar. We can point out the original to each of them, in the
writings of others. We would not do an author wrong. We would
be the last to discourage talent, but we do not believe that Mr.
Simms is one to give a helping hand to our literature, but, on the
reverse, he will injure it. Aside from his works, we know nothing
of him, and therefore cannot have “set down aught in malice.”
He proposes “a series” of works, of which “The Partisan” is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the first,—three to be devoted to the events of the Revolution in
South Carolina; and we cannot calculate the number destined for
other parts of the country. But he says, “I know not that I shall
complete, or even continue the series; much will depend upon the
reception of the present narrative.” There is then yet some small
hope that the threatened inundation may not flow upon us. Heaven
grant that voices enough may be raised to stay the coming flood,
and say, “<em>peace, be still</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is a most beautiful epitaph upon Sophocles, composed by
Limmias, the Theban. In the first place, I will render it literally
and consecutively into plain English, although, reader, thou knowest
that—saving only in the Bible—the life and loveliness of all poetry
dies under this <em>ossifying</em> process. “Gently over the tomb of Sophocles,
gently, oh! ivy, mayst thou creep, pouring thy green curls
abroad; and all about it may the petals of the rose bloom, and the
grape-loving vine, scattering its moist branches around, on account of
the wise docility, which he of the honey-tongue displayed, among
the Muses and the Graces.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was thus elegantly translated many years since:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wind, gentle evergreen, to form a shade</div>
      <div class='line'>Around the tomb where Sophocles is laid:</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet ivy, wind thy boughs, and intertwine</div>
      <div class='line'>With blushing roses and the clustering vine;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus will thy lasting leaves, with beauties hung,</div>
      <div class='line'>Prove grateful emblems of the lays he sung,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose soul, exalted like a god of wit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Among the Muses and the Graces writ.</div>
    </div>

<p class='c010'>Beautifully done—yet somewhat marred by the incongruous idea

</div>

<p class='c010'>Reader, our salutation must be brief—our correspondents have left us but brief
space, in which to give it thee; nevertheless, we cannot take our leave, without
introducing to you the dignified personage on our title-page. ’Tis but his likeness.
He has long since gone—otherwise, we should not dare take upon ourselves
this familiarity; but now we may here both gaze at, and converse about
him with freedom. All will readily recognize that distinguished individual,
<span class='sc'>Gov. Elihu Yale</span>, the patron of our Institution, (whose name it bears,) and the
benefactor of mankind. We have not space, were we able, to give him his deserts.
Let his epitaph, written in the good old style, and being that which expresses
most in the fewest words, speak for us.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The “Lines to M. S.” and “A Sabbath Morning,” were received
too late for insertion. They shall appear soon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “Lover’s Avowal,” is not after the present fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little Jane” is wanting in dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>O.’s piece is rejected. We felt ourselves somewhat endangered
in the perusal, particularly in the stormy parts of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>H. and Imo, are respectfully declined.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are highly pleased with the “Dramatic Fragment.” It shall
appear in our next.</p>

<p class='c010'>An <em>apology</em> for establishing a Literary Magazine, in an institution
like Yale College, can hardly be deemed requisite by an enlightened
public; yet a statement of the objects which are proposed
in this Periodical, may not be out of place.</p>

<p class='c011'>To foster a literary spirit, and to furnish a medium for its exercise;
to rescue from utter waste the many thoughts and musings of
a student’s leisure hours; and to afford some opportunity to train
ourselves for the strife and collision of mind which we must expect
in after life;—such, and similar motives have urged us to this undertaking.</p>

<p class='c011'>So long as we confine ourselves to these simple objects, and do
not forget the modesty becoming our years and station, we confidently
hope for the approbation and support of all who wish well
to this institution.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c011'>The work will be printed on fine paper and good type. Three
numbers to be issued every term, each containing about 40 pages,
8vo.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Conditions</em>—$2,00 per annum, if paid in advance, or 75 cents
at the commencement of each term.</p>

<p class='c011'>Communications may be addressed through the Post Office, “To
the Editors of the Yale Literary Magazine.”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c011'>This No. contains 2½ sheets. Postage, under 100 miles, 3¾
cents; over 100 miles, 6¼ cents.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. If any one is curious enough to make the inquiry, I can inform him, that this
story is founded on fact;—the individual, herein mentioned, was a graduate of
this Institution.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. The inquiry has naturally arisen, how these Confessions came into his possession,
who presented them to the Editors of this Magazine. It can be answered in
a few words. While a class, which has since graduated, was in its Junior year, it
was joined by an individual of rather rustic manners, dressed in a complete suit of
grey cloth; yet he was by no means deficient in that important requisite, manly
beauty. He roomed alone, and mingled but little with his classmates. It was observed
that his temperament was exceedingly variable, sometimes highly excited,
at others, as much depressed. His recitations evinced talents of a high order.
He continued with the class until the close of the year, and then disappeared. His
classmates have heard nothing from him since. In his table-drawer—left by accident
or design—these manuscripts were found, which, with a few alterations,
are now presented to the public.</p>
